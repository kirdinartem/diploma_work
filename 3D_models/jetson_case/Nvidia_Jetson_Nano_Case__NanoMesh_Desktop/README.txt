# Summary

**NanoMesh Desktop**: a model for a Jetson Nano Developer Kit designed for desktop use. This is designed to fully enclose the Nano Dev Kit and fan. The open mesh pattern provides ventilation. 

This isn't meant to be the least-material used design. I wanted something fairly sturdy that could serve as a more of a permanent fixture on a desktop.

This is a sister-design to the NanoMesh Mini that is a more compact case design – NanoMesh Mini – https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3547555

Parts:
qty 4: m3 x 8mm (to attach carrier board to case)
qty 4: m3 x 30-50mm (to attach case pieces) 

Assembly:
This Jetson Nano Dev Kit case accommodates the Noctua NF-A4x20 5V PWM fan attached directly to the heat sink. The Jetson Nano carrier board can be attached with 4 x m3 screws.

The top may be held either with a friction fit, or it may be screwed in with 4 x m3 that are 30-50m in length. The screw holes are countersunk and accessible from underneath the case. 

Please post a make if you decide to make one!

# Print Settings

Rafts: No
Supports: No
Infill: 20%

Notes: 
Designed to print entirely without supports in two pieces. You may need to rotate to the flat side of each piece. There is plenty of clearance in this case for ventilation so PLA should be a fine material choice. 

2 perimeters with 20% infill should be just fine. A slight optimization in printing – you may choose to print the portion of the case containing the "stanchions" for the I/O shield with a solid infill. This can be accomplished in many slicers with a infill modifier applied to just that section of the model.
